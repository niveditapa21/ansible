Step 1. Master:

make ansible user:                                 useradd ansible
change password for ansible user:                  passwd ansible
privilege to normal user as ansible user:          ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
switch to ansible user:                            su ansible

Step 2. Client:

make ansible user:                                useradd ansible
change password for ansible user:                 passwd ansible
switch to ansible user:                           su ansible
password authentication:                          nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    PasswordAuthentication yes(uncomment it)
restart sshd:                                     service sshd restart

Step 3 . Master
switch to ansible user:                            su ansible
Generate key:                                      ssh-keygen
To see the key                                     ls -al
To copy the key to slave/client:                   ssh-copy-id ansible@private-ip of slave
exit & now become a root user, after this install ansible: yum install ansible -y
