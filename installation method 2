Step1:
*******************
Create three instances: Master
                        Node1
                        node2
Step2:
*****************
Rename to desired hostname: Master ----->  sudo hostnamectl set-hostname master
                            Node1 ------>   sudo hostnamectl set-hostname node1
                            Node2 ------>   sudo hostnamectl set-hostname node2

Step3: (this step has to perform on all three nodes)
***************************************************
Create ansible user on Master , Node1, Node2:
useradd ansible
passwd ansible

The above ansible user should sudoer/should be in wheel group:( to do on all three nodes)
sudo usermod -aG wheel ansible

check it:
id ansible

Go to sudoer file,by: --> visudo OR nano /etc/sudoers --->   replace  -->  "wheel" with "ansible" ---> ansible ALL=(ALL)  ALL  ,  check it, by:  --->  cat /etc/sudoers | grep -i ansible
                                                                      -->  "wheel" with "ansible" -->  ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL  [Note: This will make ansible to run any command on client without passsword]

Step4:(on all three machines)
********
To enable password authentication so that it must ask password while exchanging the ssh-keys in the ssh configuration file:

nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config  ---> Uncomment   ==> PasswordAuthentication yes

Step5:
********
Then to restart the sshd service --->  service sshd restart

Step 6:(on all three machines)
********
Install pip and python on three of the machines:
pip: ---> yum install pip -y  OR   yum install pip3 -y

Python: --> yum install python3 -y 

Step7:(only on master)
*********************
Switch to ansible user  --> sudo su - ansible

install ansible -->  python3 -m pip install --user ansible

check it --> ansible --version

ssh key generation  -->  ssh-keygen
                         ls -lrta  (to find the ssh key in the list)
                         cd .ssh/
                         cd


copy the ssh-key to both the node  --> ssh-copy-id ansible@private-ip-address (node1)

                                       ssh-copy-id ansible@private-ip-address (node2)

Now, try logging into both the machines from master: --> ssh ansible@private-ip-address (node1)
                                                         ssh ansible@private-ip-address (node2)


Now, there is a must to have ansible.cfg (its a configuration file for ansible)  and inventory/hosts files on master(being ansible user):

vim ansible.cfg
[defaults]
inventory = hosts (Note: hosts is the file name in which nodes/clients ip will  be mentioned,so file name can be anything)
remote_user = ansible
[privilege_escalation]
become = True
become_method = sudo
become_user = root
become_ask_pass = False


nano hosts
[group-name]
webserver1 ansible_hosts=private/public-ip of node1
webserver2 ansible_hosts=private/public-ip of node2


Talk to client nodes from master machine:
ansible all -m ping
